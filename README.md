Intro to machine learning in python

This was a class project where we learned 2 forms of machine learning. The first was through the example of the 8 puzzle problem, which I worked on various implementations of, some working and some that require more work. Each implementation has different boundaries and aspects that is listed in a comment on each file. 

The second was research into building and implementing nueral networks through python. Although the class requirement was to learn how to build a basic 3 layer, 15-12-10, network that would take in a "visual" number input and return what the computer thought the number was, I went further and also learned how keras models would work for this project and have implementations that use keras to build more advanced models with different activation methods and layers. For time-saving sake, at the time the visual aspect was not included in the project, but if needed is a very simple implmentation. The machine learning aspect of the project works as expected.
